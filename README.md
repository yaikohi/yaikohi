- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @yaikohi
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in front-end development but also in everything else...
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - a school project (an absence request system for internal use) with other students using vue 3/laravel.
  - a website for myself using sveltekit.

- ğŸ“« You can contact me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-beem-3a245a117/)!

My school account is @yaikohu with an 'u' at the end instead of an 'i'.
